# Part 1. Chaining models: Use mutiple models in an application

The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package includes security barrier sample which uses 3 models to detect cars, their number plates, color and number plate attributes from the input video or image of the cars. The sample demo script is provided in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package to run the sample.

export SV=/opt/intel/workshop/smart-video-workshop/
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
cd $HOME/inference_engine_demos_build/intel64/Release

cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/demo/
sudo ./demo_security_barrier_camera.sh

# gedit demo_security_barrier_camera.sh


# Part 2. Use multiple models on different hardware

# Do make on the below directory to generate the interactive face_detection_demo

/home/ubuntu/inference_engine_demos_build/interactive_face_detection_demo
make

source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.s
h
cd $HOME/inference_engine_demos_build/intel64/Release
 ./interactive_face_detection_demo -h

We cannot do interactive face detection demo on the remote vm.

The rest of the handson is about interactive face detection on multiple devices GPU, stick etc
which we cannot do.
